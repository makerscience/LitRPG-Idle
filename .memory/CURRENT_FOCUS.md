# CURRENT_FOCUS

## One-liner
- Building a LitRPG idle/clicker game with a snarky SYSTEM narrator, using Phaser + Vite + break_infinity.js.

## Active Objectives (max 3)
1. Complete Phase 0: Environment setup + guardrails (Phaser boots, events.js, config.js)
2. Establish project file structure per architecture plan
3. Get a colored rectangle rendering in browser as proof of life

## Next Actions
- [ ] Run `npm init` and install dependencies (phaser, break_infinity.js, vite)
- [ ] Create `index.html`, `src/main.js` with Phaser boot + blank scene + colored rectangle
- [ ] Create `src/events.js` with canonical event strings from ARCHITECTURE
- [ ] Create `src/config.js` with damage formulas and balance constants
- [ ] Set canvas size to 1280x720

## Open Loops / Blockers
- Node.js must be installed on this machine
- (none currently)

## How to Resume in 30 Seconds
- **Open:** `.memory/CURRENT_FOCUS.md`
- **Next:** Execute the first unchecked item in "Next Actions"
- **If unclear:** Run "Follow the Session Start Protocol"

## Key Context
