- Decision: Governance-only memory (no MCP server) using CLAUDE.md + .memory files.
- Rationale: Minimum complexity while maintaining continuity across sessions.
- Alternatives considered: Full MCP project-memory server with ChromaDB.
- Consequences / Follow-ups: If memory friction grows, revisit adding MCP later.

- Decision: BigNum.js exports utility functions (D, format, fromJSON) — not a Decimal subclass. State holds live Decimal instances; strings only in localStorage.
- Rationale: Decimal already has toJSON() → string. No wrapper class needed. JSON.stringify just works.
- Alternatives considered: Custom BigNum class wrapping Decimal.
- Consequences / Follow-ups: All mutation methods must use D() to construct Decimals. Hydration in Store.loadState() converts strings → Decimals.

- Decision: Store is a module singleton with named mutation methods as the only write path. SaveManager receives Store as init() parameter.
- Rationale: Avoids circular imports. Named methods give a clear audit trail + event emission.
- Alternatives considered: Store as class instance, SaveManager importing Store directly.
- Consequences / Follow-ups: Every new state field needs a corresponding mutation method or integration into an existing one.
